None of what I write here is original work.\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind the development of Flix is static analysis, which performs an over-approximation of program behaviour. The idea behind most static analyses is that they compute an abstract state that over-approximates all possible states that a program can reach. Typically, the abstract states form a lattice, and computing the \"best\" (least) approximation can be done by starting with the $\\bot$ abstract state, and iteratively applying a monotone abstract transfer function on $\\bot$ until the least fixed point is reached.\nOne of the challenges when working with static analyzers is that the computation of fixed points imposes many mutual dependencies, and worklist algorithms that do so are complex. This causes implementations of such algorithms to be\n\nbrittle; changes to the specification or the problem domain requires significant rewrites/restructuring of the implementation\ncomplex; implementations of worklist algorithms that compute fixed points are difficult to understand and does not concisely convey the \"spirit\" of the algorithm\ndifficult to optimize; due to the above, implementing optimizations to worklist algorithms, both on an engineering level and an algorithm level, is nontrivial\n\nAs such, some analysis designers use Datalog, a logic programming language that supports the concise expression of fixed point problems by merely specifying relations and rules. In addition, Datalog solvers implement optimizations such as index selection, query planning and parallel execution.\nLoosely, Datalog operates on facts and rules. Facts are essentially predicates that are assumed to be true, for example, \"Alice is a parent of Bob\". This can be written as parent(alice, bob). Rules are ways to infer new facts from existing relations. For example, we can write ancestor(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z). which says that X is an ancestor of Z if X is the parent of some Y such that Y is an ancestor of Z. After defining facts and rules, users can perform queries from the Datalog solver, which uses the facts and rules to infer more facts to answer the query.\nLattices and Kleene's Fixed-Point Theorem\nAs a quick aside, before we talk about Datalog and Flix, we shall describe lattices and fixed points, which will give more context behind how Datalog, Flix, and static analyses in general, work.\nPartial Orders\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Partial Order).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A partial order $\\sqsubseteq$ on a set $P$ is a reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric relation on $P$:\n\nReflexive: $\\forall x\\in P.~x \\sqsubseteq x$\nTransitive: $\\forall x, y, z \\in P.~x \\sqsubseteq y \\land y \\sqsubseteq z \\to x \\sqsubseteq z$\nAntisymmetric: $\\forall x,y \\in P. x \\sqsubseteq y \\land y \\sqsubseteq x \\to x = y$\n\n$(P,\\sqsubseteq)$ is a partially ordered set.\n\n    \n  \n\nPartially ordered sets can be enriched to form lattices. There are many variants of lattices, each with some additional features, but for us we shall use the broad term \"lattice\" to describe partially ordered sets with all the features that we want.\nLattices\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Lattice).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A lattice $(L,\\sqsubseteq,\\sqcup,\\sqcap)$ is such that:\n\n$(L, \\sqsubseteq)$ is a partially ordered set\nEvery pair of elements $a,b\\in L$ has a least upper bound $a \\sqcup b \\in L$, which is an element $x$ such that $a\\sqsubseteq x$ and $b \\sqsubseteq x$ and $\\forall y \\in L.~ a\\sqsubseteq y \\land b\\sqsubseteq y \\to x \\sqsubseteq y$. $\\sqcup$ is also known as a binary join.\nEvery pair of elements $a,b\\in L$ has a greatest lower bound $a \\sqcap b \\in L$, which is an element $x$ such that $x\\sqsubseteq a$ and $x \\sqsubseteq b$ and $\\forall y \\in L.~ y\\sqsubseteq a \\land y\\sqsubseteq b \\to y \\sqsubseteq x$. $\\sqcap$ is also known as a binary meet.\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Complete Lattice).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A complete lattice $(L,\\sqsubseteq,\\sqcup,\\sqcap,\\top,\\bot)$ is a lattice with greatest and least elements $\\top$ and $\\bot$ such that every subset of $L$ has an infimum (meet of all elements in subset) and a supremum (join of all elements in subset):\n\nFor every subset $Y \\subseteq L$, $\\inf Y$ is an element $x$ in $L$ such that $\\forall y \\in Y.~x\\sqsubseteq y$ and $\\forall z\\in L.\\ (\\forall y\\in Y.\\ z \\sqsubseteq y)\\to z \\sqsubseteq x$.\nFor every subset $Y \\subseteq L$, $\\sup Y$ is an element $x$ in $L$ such that $\\forall y \\in Y.~y\\sqsubseteq x$ and $\\forall z\\in L.\\ (\\forall y\\in Y.\\ y \\sqsubseteq z)\\to x \\sqsubseteq z$.\n$\\top = \\sup L = \\inf \\emptyset$\n$\\bot = \\inf L = \\sup\\emptyset$\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      The powerset of any set, when ordered by inclusion, is a complete lattice. In other words, given any set $S$, $(\\mathcal{P}(S), \\subseteq, \\cup,\\cap,S,\\emptyset)$ is a complete lattice. Every subset $Y$ of $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ has an infimum given by $\\inf Y = \\bigcap Y$ and supremum given by $\\sup Y = \\bigcup Y$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Any nonempty finite lattice is complete. The infimum of any subset $Y = \\{s_1,\\dots,s_n\\}$ of the lattice is $s_1\\sqcap s_2\\sqcap\\dots\\sqcap s_n$. Argue dually for the supremum.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Nonexample.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $(\\mathbb{R}, \\leq, \\max,\\min)$ is not a complete lattice. Although $\\max$ and $\\min$ are binary joins, the maximum and minimum elements do not always exist in a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ (they do not even exist in $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\n    \n  \n\nIn static analysis, lattice elements are usually the possible properties of some point of a program. For example, in data-flow analysis, we attempt to determine the possible values of a variable at a certain program point. Take the following example C program:\n\nThen, the set of all possible values x can have is $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ since these are the only constants in the program. To best approximate the possible values of x at each program point, we will assign to each program point a subset of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ which denotes the best approximation of the possible values that x can have at that point. To start off, x is given an initial set of possible values $\\emptyset$ at every program point. Next, in the first assignment statement, x is assigned 0, so at that program point, the possible values x can have now becomes $\\{0\\} \\cup \\emptyset = \\{0\\}$. Similarly, in each branch of the if statement, the possible values x can have are $\\{1\\}$ and $\\{2\\}$ respectively. Finally, at the printf statement, x could have inherited the possible values from either branch, in which case we take the union of the possible values from both branches, concluding that at that program point, the possible values of x is $\\{1, 2\\}$. Recall from above that these subsets of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$ are elements of the powerset lattice of $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, and taking unions are lattice joins, and the initial possible values is $\\emptyset$, which is $\\bot$.\nChains\nBefore we talk about being able to determine the \"best approximation\" of program properties, we shall first describe some properties of lattices that allow us to compute this best approximation.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Chain).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A subset $Y\\subseteq L$ of a partially ordered set $(L, \\sqsubseteq)$ is a chain if it is totally ordered by $\\sqsubseteq$, i.e. it is such that\n$$\n\\forall y_1,y_2 \\in Y.\\ y_1 \\sqsubseteq y_2 \\lor y_2 \\sqsubseteq y_1\n$$\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Ascending and Descending Chains).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A sequence of elements $l_1,l_2,\\dots$ is an ascending chain if\n$$\n\\forall n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}.\\ n \\leq m \\to l_n \\sqsubseteq l_m\n$$\nSimilarly, a sequence of elements $l_1,l_2,\\dots$ is a descending chain if\n$$\n\\forall n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}.\\ n \\leq m \\to l_m \\sqsubseteq l_n\n$$\n\n    \n  \n\nFrom the definitions above, it is clear that both ascending and descending chains are also chains (to see this, put every element in the ascending/descending chain in a set; clearly, $\\sqsubseteq$ is now a total order on that set).\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Eventually Stabilize).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A sequence of elements $l_1,l_2,\\dots$ eventually stabilizes if and only if:\n$$\n\\exists c \\in \\mathbb{N}.\\ \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}.\\ n \\geq c \\to l_n = l_c\n$$\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Chain Conditions).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A partially ordered set $(L, \\sqsubseteq)$ has finite height if and only if all chains are finite.\nA partially ordered set $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ satisfies the ascending chain condition if and only if all ascending chains eventually stabilize. Similarly, it satisfies the descending chain condition if and only if all descending chains eventually stabilize.\n\n    \n  \n\n(Complete) lattices that meet the ascending/descending chain condition(s) or have finite height are particularly interesting for us because it gives us a procedure for computing the \"best\" approximations of program properties in static analyses, and in fact, in many other domains such as graph theory and parsing.\nFunctions and Fixed Points\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Fixed Point).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $x \\in A$ is a fixed point of a function $f: A \\to A$ if $x = f(x)$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Monotone).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose $(L, \\sqsubseteq_L)$ and $(M, \\sqsubseteq_M)$ are partially ordered sets. A function $f: L \\to M$ is monotone if\n$$\n\\forall x,y\\in L.\\ x \\sqsubseteq_L y \\to f(x) \\sqsubseteq_M f(y)\n$$\nIn other words, $f$ is monotone if it is order preserving.\n\n    \n  \n\nTypically, the way static analyses improve the approximation of program properties is with monotone transfer functions, that give more information about the properties of a program point incrementally and monotonically. In a sense, it does not \"subtract\" old information, and only adds new information to it.\nKleene's Fixed-Point Theorem\nWe now finally describe Kleene's Fixed-Point Theorem, which shows that given certain conditions, we can compute the best approximation of a program property iteratively using a monotone function.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Kleene's Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have a partially ordered set $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ with a least element $\\bot$ that meets the ascending chain condition. Then, given any monotone function $f: L \\to L$, the least fixed point of $f$ (denoted $lfp(f)$) exists and is obtained by\n$$\nlfp(f) = f^n(\\bot)\n$$\nfor some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and such that $f^n(\\bot) = f^{n + 1}(\\bot)$.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. First we show that $f^n(\\bot)$ is indeed a fixed point of $f$. By definition, $\\bot \\sqsubseteq f(\\bot)$. Because $f$ is monotone, $f(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f(f(\\bot))$, i.e. $\\bot \\sqsubseteq f(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f(f(\\bot))$. We can thus show with induction that the sequence $\\bot, f(\\bot), f(f(\\bot)),\\dots$ is an ascending chain. Because $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ meets the ascending chain condition, this ascending chain eventually stabilizes, hence there will be some $n$ such that $f^n(\\bot) = f^{m}(\\bot)$ for all $m \\geq n$. As such, since $f^n(\\bot) = f(f^n(\\bot))$, $f^n(\\bot)$ is a fixed point.\nNow we show that $f^n(\\bot)$ is the least fixed point, i.e. if $x$ is another fixed point of $f$ then $f^n(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq x$. Firstly, $\\bot \\sqsubseteq x$ by definition. Next, because $f$ is monotone and $x$ is a fixed point, we also know that for all $i \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $f^i(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq x \\to f^{i + 1}(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq f(x) = x$. Therefore, by induction, $f^n(\\bot) \\sqsubseteq x$ for all $n$, which means that $f^n(\\bot)$ is indeed the least fixed point of $f$.\n\nKleene's Fixed-Point Theorem thus shows us that as long as we have a partially ordered set whose elements describe program properties, that meets the ascending chain condition, and has a bottom element, and a monotone function $f$ that improves our approximations of program properties, to get the best approximation, we start from $\\bot$ and repeatedly apply $f$ until a fixed point arises.\nIn fact, dually, the greatest fixed point of a monotone function can also be obtained from a partially ordered set that meets the descending chain condition and has a greatest element $\\top$.\nConnections to Complete Lattices\nThe following theorem shows the connections between partially ordered sets that have least fixed points and complete lattices.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Theorem.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A partially ordered set $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ is a complete lattice that meets the ascending chain condition if and only if it has a least element $\\bot$ and binary joins $\\sqcup$ and meets the ascending chain condition.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. The forward implication is shown by definition so we prove the converse. To do so, we shall prove the following lemma to simplify our main proof.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Lemma.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Every subset $Y$ of a partially ordered set $(L, \\sqsubseteq)$ has a supremum if and only if $(L,\\sqsubseteq)$ is a complete lattice.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. The backward implication is shown by definition so we prove the forward implication only. Let $Y \\subseteq L$. We then have an element $x$ in $L$ that is the supremum of all elements of $L$ less than all elements in $Y$:\n$$\nx = \\sup \\{l \\in L\\ |\\ \\forall l' \\in Y.\\ l \\sqsubseteq l'\\}\n$$\n$x$ is in fact the infimum of $Y$ since the set $\\{l \\in L\\ |\\ \\forall l' \\in Y.\\ l \\sqsubseteq l'\\}$ is the set of all elements in $L$ that are less than (or equal to) all the elements of $Y$ (these are all lower bounds) and its supremum is necessarily the greatest among them.\nAs such, since every subset of $L$ has infima and suprema, $L$ itself has an infimum $\\bot$ and a supremum $\\top$ and is thus a complete lattice.\n\nReturning to our main proof obligation, using our freshly proven lemma it suffices to show that all subsets $Y$ of $L$ have a supremum. If $Y$ is empty, then clearly $\\sup Y = \\bot$ so this case is proven.\nNow suppose $Y$ is nonempty and finite, i.e. $Y = \\{y_1, \\dots, y_n\\}$ for $n \\geq 1$. $\\sup Y$ is clearly $y_1\\sqcup y_2\\sqcup\\dots\\sqcup y_n$.\nThe last case is more tricky. Suppose $Y$ is infinite. We shall construct the following sequence $l_0, l_1,\\dots$ inductively:\n\nLet $l_0$ be an arbitrary element $y_0$.\nGiven $l_n$ let $l_{n + 1}$ be\n\n$l_n$ if $\\forall y \\in Y.\\ y \\sqsubseteq l_n$\n$l_n \\sqcup y_{n + 1}$ for some $y_{n + 1} \\in Y$ such that $y_{n + 1} \\not\\sqsubseteq l_n$.\n\n\n\nEssentially, the sequence starts with $y_0$, and each successive element is obtained by joining it with an element of $Y$ that is not less than the latest element of the sequence, and does so until the sequence arrives at an element of $L$ that is greater than every element of $Y$, and remains that way indefinitely.\nNotice that the sequence $l_0, l_1, \\dots$ is an ascending chain. Furthermore, because $(L, \\sqsubseteq)$ meets the ascending chain condition, this ascending chain eventually stabilizes, so there is some $n$ such that $l_n = l_{n + 1} = l_{n + 2} = \\dots$. However, the chain itself is not particularly important. The key part of the construction of this chain is that it eventually stabilizes, and based on its construction, it means that eventually after a finite number of elements, we get to a point such that there is some $l_n$ where subsequent elements are the same, and that means that this $l_n$ satisfies the property of being greater than all elements in $Y$—making this an upper bound of $Y$ (otherwise, it means that there is some $y$ such that $y \\not\\sqsubseteq l_n$, and therefore $y \\sqcup l_n \\neq l_n$, which would be a contradiction1).\n$l_n$ is in fact the least upper bound i.e. supremum of $Y$, by virtue of the fact that $l_n$ is the least upper bound of the subset of $Y$ $\\{y_0, y_1,\\dots,y_n\\}$ because it is constructed by $y_0 \\sqcup y_1\\sqcup \\dots\\sqcup y_n$. Thus, since $l_n$ is an upper bound of $Y$, and is the least upper bound of $\\{y_0,y_1,\\dots,y_n\\}$, it is also the least upper bound of $Y$.\n\nTherefore, requiring a partially ordered set be a complete lattice that satisfies the ascending chain condition is no stricter, and is in fact equivalent, as requiring it to have $\\bot$, joins and meet the ascending chain condition.\nA Brief Introduction to Datalog\nAs stated in the introduction, Datalog programs consists of facts and rules. Facts are essentially rules with no premise.\nWe show the syntax of a datalog program here.\n\nEvery Datalog program satisfies range restriction, i.e. in the production R above, every variable appearing in the head of the rule (A0) must also appear in the body A1, ..., An. The following is an example Datalog program:\n\nSemantics\nThere are several ways to describe the semantics of a Datalog program. The most straightforward way to do so is to do so model-theoretically.\nModel-Theoretic Semantics\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Ground Terms and Atoms).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A ground term is a non-variable constant value appearing somewhere in a program.\nA ground atom is a predicate symbol whose arguments are ground terms.\nA ground rule is a rule where all atoms are ground.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Herbrand Universe and Base of Datalog Program).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      The Herbrand Universe $\\mathcal{U}$ of a Datalog program $P$ is the set of all ground terms appearing in $P$.\nThe Herbrand Base $\\mathcal{B}$ of a Datalog program $P$ is the set of all ground atoms where the predicate appears in $P$ and whose arguments are drawn from $\\mathcal{U}$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Given the Datalog program\n\nWe have $\\mathcal{U} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathcal{B} = \\{A(1), A(2), A(3), B(1, 1), B(1, 2), B(1, 3), B(2, 1), B(2, 2), B(2, 3), B(3, 1), B(3, 2), B(3, 3)\\}$\n\n    \n  \n\nAs you can see, the Herbrand Base $\\mathcal{B}$ describes the set of all possible2 facts.\nThe model-theoretic semantics define the minimal model of a Datalog program to be its meaning.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Interpretation of Datalog Program).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      An interpretation $I$ of a Datalog program $P$ is a subset $I \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nA ground atom $A$ is true w.r.t. an interpretation $I$ if $A \\in I$.\nA conjunction of atoms $A_1,\\dots,A_n$ is true w.r.t. an interpretation if each atom is true in the interpretation.\nA ground rule is true w.r.t. to an interpretation if either the body conjunction is false or the head is true.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nThis allows us to describe the minimal Herbrand model of a Datalog program.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Ground Instance).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A ground rule $R_1$ is a ground instance of another rule $R_2$ if $R_1$ is the result of a substitution of constants for all the variables in $R_2$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      From our example program, A(1) :- B(1, 3) is a ground instance of the rule A(x) :- B(x, _).\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition (Model).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A model $M$ of a Datalog program $P$ is an interpretation that makes every ground instance of every rule in $P$ true. A model $M$ of a Datalog program $P$ is a minimal Herbrand model if no other models $M'$ of $P$ are such that $M' \\subset M$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Let us go back to our example program and list out every single ground instance of every rule in the program.\n\nEach of these are ground rules (the first two rules are facts in the Datalog program, which are just rules without a body). The goal is to find an interpretation that makes all these rules true.\nThe empty interpretation $\\emptyset$ is not a model of $P$. This is because the first two ground rules are not true with respect to $\\emptyset$.\nHowever, the interpretation $\\{A(1), B(2, 3)\\}$ is not a model of $P$ either. This is because although the first two ground rules are now true, the rules A(2) :- B(2, 3) is false because B(2, 3) is true but A(2) is false. The other rules are true because the body of the rules are false.\nOne valid model is $\\{A(1), A(2), B(1, 1), B(2, 3)\\}$, which makes all the rules true. However, it is not minimal. Instead the model $\\{A(1), A(2), B(2, 3)\\}$ is the minimal model of the program.\n\n    \n  \n\nFixed-Point Semantics\nTODO.\n\n1\nIf $x \\not\\sqsubseteq y$ then $x \\sqcup y \\neq y$. This is showed immediately by contradiction. Suppose $x \\not \\sqsubseteq y$ but $x \\sqcup y = y$. By definition of $\\sqcup$ it means that $x \\sqsubseteq (x \\sqcup y)$ i.e. $x \\sqsubseteq y$, which is a contradiction.\n\n2\nThe Herbrand Base $\\mathcal{B}$ does not consist only of \"true facts\", i.e. there could be \"facts\" that should not be derived from the rules and facts existing in the program. $\\mathcal{B}$ simply consists of all ground atoms that could possibly be derived from the program.\n\nReferences\n\nMagnus Madsen, Ming-Ho Yee, and Ondřej Lhoták. 2016.

You may also likely have heard that these terms are defined in category theory. However, without any knowledge of category theory, sayings like \"a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?\" can be incredibly frustrating, and the connections between functors and monads in the programming sense and those in category theory are not immediately apparent.\nThrough this article I hope to give readers enough background in category theory to understand that functors, monads etc. in the usual programming sense do not only correspond loosely to those found in category theory, but are indeed exactly the same, i.e. a functor in the programming sense is exactly a functor in some category. However, I shall not cover functional programming fundamentals; these are presumed to be understood and known by the reader (readers who have not acquired sufficient background can do so with the wide variety of resources online). Instead, this article draws equalities between the functional programming constructs we know of, and their category-theoretic definitions. In addition, due to this presumption, the majority of this article starts with the math before showing the correspondence with code.\nIn this article, I offer to show:\n\nThe definition of a category, showing that we can assemble types in a programming language into one (#Categories);\nFunctors in the usual programming sense are exactly categorical functors on our category of types (#Functors);\nProduct and function types in the usual programming sense are precisely product and exponential objects in our category of types (#Universal Properties);\nMonoids in the usual programming sense are precisely monoids in our category of types induced by the categorical product and the unit type (#Monoids);\nMonads in the usual programming sense are precisely monads on our category of types, which are monoids in the category of endofunctors of our category of types, which is a strict monoidal category induced by functor composition and the identity functor (#Monads);\nMonads in the usual programming sense that obey the monad laws in the usual programming sense, precisely define monads in the categorical sense.\n\nCategories\nTo even begin our discussion we must first describe what category theory is. Intuitively, most theories (especially the algebraic ones) study mathematical structures that abstract over things; groups are abstractions of symmetries, and geometric spaces are abstractions of space. Category theory takes things one step further and study abstraction itself.\nEffectively the goal of category theory is to observe similar underlying structures between collections of mathematical structures. What is nice about this is that a result from category theory generalizes to all other theories that fit the structure of a category. As such it should be no surprise that computation can be studied in category theory too!\nOn the other hand, the generality of category theory also makes it incredibly abstract and difficult to understand—this is indeed the case in our very first definition. As such, I will, as much as possible, show you \"concrete\" examples of each definition and reason about them if I can. With this in mind, let us start with the definition of a category, as seen in many sources.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 1 (Category).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A category $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of a collection of objects, $X, Y, Z, \\dots$, denoted $\\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C})$a collection of morphisms, $f, g, h, \\dots$, denoted $\\text{mor}(\\mathcal{C})$so that:Each morphism has specified domain and codomain objects; when we write $f: X \\to Y$, we mean that the morphism $f$ has domain $X$ and codomain $Y$.Each object has an identity morphism $1_X:X\\rightarrow X$.For any pair of morphisms $f$, $g$ with the codomain of $f$ equal to the domain of $g$ (i.e. $f$ and $g$ are composable), there exists a composite morphism $g \\circ f$ whose domain is equal to the domain of $f$ and whose codomain is equal to the codomain of $g$, i.e. $$\nf: X\\rightarrow Y, ~~~g: Y \\rightarrow Z ~~~~~ \\rightsquigarrow ~~~~~ g\\circ f:X\\rightarrow Z\n$$\n\nComposition of morphisms is subject to the two following axioms:\n\nUnity. For any $f: X \\rightarrow Y$, $f\\circ1_X = 1_Y \\circ f = f$.\nAssociativity. For any composable $f$, $g$ and $h$, $(h\\circ g)\\circ f = h \\circ (g \\circ f)$.\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\nAs you can see, there is very little describing what a category is, or how to construct one. In category theory, we do not care (that much) about the construction of objects of morphisms; as long as they satisfy the definition of a category, we may work with them in a categorical framework. This allows many different kinds of objects to all assemble into categories.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 1.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      The category of sets, $\\textbf{Set}$, contains sets (like $\\mathbb{N}$ and ${1, 2, 3}$) as objects, and as morphisms, functions between sets (like $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$). From this example, we can see that there can be more than one morphism between two objects in a category. The identity morphism for each object $\\mathbb{A}$ is the function $1_\\mathbb{A}: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}$ where $1_\\mathbb{A}(x) = x$.\n\n    \n  \n\nOur construction of $\\textbf{Set}$ indeed forms a category1.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Theorem 1.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $\\textbf{Set}$ is a category.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. Given objects (sets) $\\mathbb{A}$, $\\mathbb{B}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$ and morphisms (functions) $f: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$ and $g: \\mathbb{B} \\rightarrow {C}$, the composite $g \\circ f: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ exists in $\\textbf{Set}$, given by $(g \\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$. Similarly, we can see that $(1_\\mathbb{B} \\circ f)(x) = 1_\\mathbb{B}(f(x)) = f(x)$ and $(f \\circ 1_\\mathbb{A})(x) = f(1_\\mathbb{A}(x)) = f(x)$, therefore showing that composition is unital. Finally, composition of functions is also associative; suppose we have another morphism $h: \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$, then $((h \\circ g) \\circ f)(x) = (h \\circ g)(f(x)) = h(g(f(x))$, and $(h \\circ (g \\circ f))(x) = h((g \\circ f)(x)) =h(g(f(x))$ too.\n\nAs stated earlier, many kinds of objects assemble into categories. Example 2 gives an example category that has (virtually) nothing to do with $\\textbf{Set}$. This category2 we shall show will be used everywhere in this article.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 2.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose some simple types in a type system exist. We can construct a category $\\mathcal{T}$ where the objects are types, and the morphisms are functions on those types, i.e. a function from A to B will be a morphism from A to B in this category—these are functions of the type A -&gt; B. In this category, composition of morphisms is straightforward: if f :: A -&gt; B and g :: B -&gt; C then its composition is (g . f) x = g (f x). Similarly, for any type A the identity morphism is the identity function id :: A -&gt; A where id x = x. We can show that what we have constructed is indeed a category, by similar proofs of associativity and unity shown in the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n    \n  \n\nComposition in categories can be described by the following commutative diagram3, that is, the following diagram commutes:\n\n  \n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nIn other words, going from object $A$ to $B$ via morphism $f$ then from $B$ to $C$ via $g$ is the same as going from $A$ to $C$ directly via $g\\circ f$. Such commutative diagrams will be useful for describing and defining further concepts later.\nFunctors\nIn mathematics, the relationships between objects are frequently far more interesting than the objects themselves. Of course, we do not just focus on any relationship between objects, but of keen interest, the structure preserving relationships between them, such as group homomorphisms that preserve group structures, or monotonic functions between preordered sets that preserve ordering. In category theory, functors are maps between categories that preserve the structure of the domain category, especially the compositions and identities.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 2 (Functor).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    Let $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ be categories. A (covariant) functor $F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$ consists of:\n\nAn object $F(C) \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{D})$ for each object $C \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C})$.\n        A morphism $F(f): F(C) \\rightarrow F(D) \\in \\text{mor}(\\mathcal{D})$ for each morphism $f: C\\rightarrow D \\in \\text{mor}(\\mathcal{C})$.\n\n    subject to the two functoriality axioms:\n\n        For any composable pair of morphisms $f, g\\in\\text{mor}(\\mathcal{C})$, $F(g)\\circ F(f) = F(g\\circ f)$.\n         For each $C \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C})$, $F(1_C)=1_{F(C)}$.\n\n    in other words, functors respect composition and identities.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nNote that when writing $C \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C})$ we abuse the notation of set membership. It is not necessary for the collections of objects and morphisms of a category to be sets, as is the case for $\\text{ob}(\\textbf{Set})$.\nWe show two diagrams below, where on the left we have a diagram in $\\mathcal{C}$ and on the right we have a diagram in $\\mathcal{D}$. Given a functor $F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$, the following diagrams commute:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 3.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \nThe powerset functor $P: \\textbf{Set} \\rightarrow \\textbf{Set}$ maps a set $\\mathbb{A}$ to its powerset $P(\\mathbb{A}) = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{A})$ and a function $f: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$ to $P(f): P(\\mathbb{A}) \\rightarrow P(\\mathbb{B})$ defined by\n$$\nP(f)(\\mathbb{X}) = \\{f(x) \\ |\\  x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\}\n$$\nIn other words, $P$ lifts a function of elements of $\\mathbb{A}$ into a function of subsets of $\\mathbb{A}$.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Theorem 2.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $P$ is a functor.\n    \n  \n\nProof. $P$ respects composition. Suppose we have $f: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$ and $g: \\mathbb{B} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$, then $P(g \\circ f)(\\mathbb{X}) = \\{(g \\circ f)(x)\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\} = \\{g(f(x))\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\}$ and $(P(g) \\circ P(f))(\\mathbb{X}) = P(g)(\\{f(x)\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\}) = \\{g(f(x))\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\}$. $P$ also respects identities. Given $1_\\mathbb{X}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{X}$ where $1_\\mathbb{X}(x) = x$, then $P(1_\\mathbb{X})(\\mathbb{X}) = \\{1_\\mathbb{X}(x)\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\} = \\{x\\ |\\ x \\in \\mathbb{X}\\} = \\mathbb{X}$, thus showing that $P(1_\\mathbb{X}) = 1_{P(\\mathbb{X})}$.\n\nThe powerset functor is one example of an endofunctor, which is a functor that has equal domain and codomain categories.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 4.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      In many languages, the list type is a type constructor that receives a type and produces a list of that type. For example, the [Int] type is produced from passing in the Int type into the [] type constructor. We shall denote the list type constructor as [], sort of as a function on types, for example, [] Int = [Int].\nFurthermore, we can define a higher order function lmap that lifts a function on elements to one on a list of those elements, like so:\n\nAs an example, lmap length [\"abc\", \"de\"] gives [3, 2].\nThen, let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the category of types described in Example 2. We can define an endofunctor $L: \\mathcal{T} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{T}$ that maps:\n\neach object (type) $\\mathtt{A} \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{T})$ to the type $L(\\mathtt{A}) = \\mathtt{[]}(\\mathtt{A}) = \\mathtt{[A]}$\neach morphism (function) f :: A -&gt; B $\\in \\text{mor}(\\mathcal{T})$ to the function $L(\\mathtt{f}) =$lmap f :: [A] -&gt; [B].\n\nThe functoriality of $L$ should be straightforward to verify.\n\n    \n  \n\nIn many programming texts, a type constructor (together with its implementation of lmap) is a functor if we have:\n\nIt should be immediately clear that our definition of lmap satisfies them. Also, you should notice that the functor laws described in the usual programming sense is precisely what is needed to define a categorical functor in $\\mathcal{T}$. As such, we can define any arbitrary functor (in the programming sense) that maps types via a type constructor and lifts function on types into functions on the types after applying the type constructor. As long as this functor satisfies the functor laws, this specifies a functor on $\\mathcal{T}$! This is precisely the motivation for the Functor typeclass in Haskell:\n\nHere, the type constructor f is a Functor when it is equipped with a way to lift functions via fmap (subject to the functoriality axioms). Since the list type constructor is already a Functor, it provides a definition of fmap that is identical to lmap which we defined earlier. We can even define our own type constructors and allow them to be Functors by providing their definitions of fmap as long as they respect composition and identities. I show an example of defining our own functor below:\n\nThe definition of a category does not necessarily preclude any particular object from being a part of a category; as such, it stands to reason that categories themselves can assemble into a category4. In such a category, the objects are categories themselves, and the morphisms between categories are functors between them. The identities for each category $\\mathcal{C}$, denoted $1_\\mathcal{C}$, are their corresponding identity functor (mapping each object and morphism to themselves) and composition of morphisms is defined by the composition of functors. The composition of functors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$ and $G: \\mathcal{D} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{E}$ is $G \\circ F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{E}$ such that for each object $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ we have $G(F(X))$ in $\\mathcal{E}$, and for each morphism $f$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ we have $G(F(f))$ in $\\mathcal{E}$. Associativity and unity of functor composition should be relatively straightforward to show.\nUniversal Properties\nIn many instances we want to characterize an object with some unique property in relation to other objects in a category via morphisms, without needing to deal with the details of some particular construction. This allows us to discover results of these objects without needing to repeat the same proofs in different categories. This is what is known as a universal property.\nBefore defining universal properties, we shall look at some examples of them first. Suppose we are in \\textbf{Set} and we have sets $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{B}$. We would like to find some set $\\mathbb{P}$ and functions $\\pi_1: \\mathbb{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}$ and $\\pi_2: \\mathbb{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$ such that, for all sets $\\mathbb{X}$ and functions $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}$ and $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$, there exists a function $p: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}$ so that $\\pi_1 \\circ p = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}$ and $\\pi_2 \\circ p = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}$. In simple terms, we are looking for $\\mathbb{P}$, $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ that allows $\\mathbb{P}$ to be a `common pit stop', or in other words, there will exist $p$ that encodes the data of both $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}$ and $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}$. As a commutative diagram, given objects $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{B}$, we want to find object $\\mathbb{P}$ and morphisms $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ such that for all objects $\\mathbb{X}$ and morphisms $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}$ and $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}$, there exists $p$ so that the following diagram commutes:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nIt turns out that the cartesian product of $\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{B}$, i.e. $\\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{B}$, is a construction of $\\mathbb{P}$:\n$$\\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{B} = \\{ (a, b) \\ |\\  a \\in \\mathbb{A}, b \\in \\mathbb{B}\\}$$\nand the following functions are constructions of $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$: $\\pi_1(a, b) = a$ and $\\pi_2(a, b) = b$. This is so that given functions $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{A}$ and $f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{B}$, $p: \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}$ would be the function $p(x) = (f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x), f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x))$. The diagram above commutes as $(\\pi_1 \\circ p)(x) = \\pi_1(f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x), f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x)) = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x)$, and $(\\pi_2 \\circ p)(x) = \\pi_2(f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x), f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x)) = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x)$.\nIn fact, notice that given our construction of $\\mathbb{P}$, $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$, $p$ is unique. Suppose $p$ is not unique, and there is another morphism $p': \\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}$ such that $\\pi_1 \\circ p' = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}$ and $\\pi_2 \\circ p' = f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}$ where $p \\neq p'$. This means that $p'(x) = (y, z)$ where either $y \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x)$ or $z \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x)$. We also know that $\\pi_1(y, z) = y$ and $\\pi_2(y, z) = z$. As such, either $(\\pi_1 \\circ p')(x) = y \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}(x)$ or $(\\pi_1 \\circ p')(x) = z \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}(x)$ so either $\\pi_1 \\circ p' \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{A}}$ or $\\pi_2 \\circ p' \\neq f_{\\mathbb{X}\\mathbb{B}}$, which is a contradiction.\nWe can now re-draw our commutative diagram, where dashed arrows represent a unique morphism:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nThis property we have described completely characterizes the categorical product of two objects in $\\textbf{Set}$. We can in fact generalize the notion of a product of two objects in any arbitrary category.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 3 (Product).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Fix category $\\mathcal{C}$. Given objects $A$ and $B$, the product of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \\times B$, equipped with morphisms $\\pi_1: A \\times B \\rightarrow A$ and $\\pi_2: A \\times B \\rightarrow B$, is such that for all objects $X$ and morphisms $f: X \\rightarrow A$ and $g: X \\rightarrow B$, there exists a unique morphism $p: X \\rightarrow A \\times B$ (denoted $\\langle f, g \\rangle$) following diagram commutes:\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\nThe universality of $A \\times B$ stems from the fact that there exists exactly one $p$, i.e. $p$ exists and is unique, thus denoted $\\langle f, g\\rangle$. This effectively gives rise to some notion of uniqueness of the product of $A$ and $B$ in any arbitrary category.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 4 (Isomorphism).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Fix category $\\mathcal{C}$. Given objects $A$ and $B$, $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is an isomorphism is there exists $g: B \\rightarrow A$ such that $g \\circ f = 1_A$ and $f \\circ g = 1_B$. If there exists an isomorphism between $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic, i.e $A \\cong B$.\n\n    \n  \n\nIsomorphisms are important in mathematics because they group objects together that have essentially the same properties despite their different representations. That means that what we discover about one object will also be true of the other. For example, if two groups $G$ and $G'$ are isomorphic, then showing $G$ is abelian tells us immediately that $G'$ is also abelian; showing $G'$ is cyclic tells us immediately that $G$ is also cyclic. Two objects being isomorphic means that the two objects are essentially the same.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Theorem 3.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Fix category $\\mathcal{C}$. Given objects $A$ and $B$, if both $P$ and $P'$ are products of $A$ and $B$, then $P \\cong P'$.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof.\nBy definition 3, because $P$ is a product, there exists a unique morphism $f$ such that the following diagram commutes:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nWe already know by definition of the identity morphism on $P$ that $\\pi_1 = \\pi_1 \\circ 1_P$ and $\\pi_2 = \\pi_2 \\circ 1_P$. Since $f$ is unique, it must be the case that $f$ is precisely $1_P$. This shows that any morphism from $P$ to $P$ that satisfies this commutative diagram must be equal to $1_P$.\nSimilarly, since $P'$ is also a product, the following diagram commutes:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nWe can argue similarly to show any morphism from $P'$ to $P'$ that satisfies the commutative diagram above must be equal to $1_{P'}$.\nNow, again by Definition 3, the following diagram commutes:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nCollapsing the diagram, once going from $P$ to $P'$ then back, and the other going from $P'$ to $P$ and back, gives us two commutative diagrams:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nCombining these diagrams with the first two diagrams above shows us that $p \\circ p' = 1_P$ and $p' \\circ p = 1_{P'}$, which implies that $p$ and $p'$ are isomorphisms, and therefore $P \\cong P'$. In fact, $P$ and $P'$ are isomorphic with a unique isomorphism $p$ and $p'$.\n\nThis gives further insight as to the universality of the categorical product of two objects: that if two objects $P$ and $P'$ have the universal property of being a product of two other objects $A$ and $B$, then there is a unique isomorphism between $P$ and $P'$—i.e. the product of $A$ and $B$ is unique up to a unique isomorphism. As such, when speaking of a product of $A$ and $B$, we can describe it as the product of $A$ and $B$, which we shall denote as $A \\times B$.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 5.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we are in the category of types $\\mathcal{T}$ and we have types A and B. Then, the type (A, B), together with projections fst' :: (A, B) -&gt; A and snd' :: (A, B) -&gt; B where fst' (a, b) = a and snd' (a, b) = b, is the product of types A and B. That means that given a type X and two functions f :: X -&gt; A and g :: X -&gt; B, we can construct a unique function p :: X -&gt; (A, B) given by p x = (f x, g x) so that fst' . p == f and snd' . p == g:\n\n\n    \n  \n\nBefore we look at another universal property, we shall provide a definition of the product of morphisms, which is similar to what we have seen earlier.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 5 (Product Morphism).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we are in a category $\\mathcal{C}$ with pairs of objects $A, A'$ and $B, B'$ admitting binary products:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nand further suppose we have morphisms $f: A \\rightarrow B$ and $f': A'\\rightarrow B'$. Then, the product morphism of $f$ and $f'$, denoted $f\\times f'$, is the unique morphism that makes the following diagram commute:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nWe can see from this diagram that the product of morphisms relates closely to the unique morphism obtained from the definition of the product of objects, i.e. $f \\times f' = \\langle f \\circ p_1, f' \\circ p_2\\rangle$.\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 6.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Forming product morphisms in $\\mathcal{T}$ is very similar to obtaining the product of two objects of a type. Let us suppose we have f :: a -&gt; b and g :: a' -&gt; b'. Then we can form the product of these two functions; this must be a function from (a, a') to (b, b'). It can be defined in the most obvious way:\n\n\n    \n  \n\nFrom this definition, we can now define the following universal property.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 6 (Exponential Object).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we are in category $\\mathcal{C}$ with objects $B$ and $C$, and $\\mathcal{C}$ contains all binary products with $B$ (i.e., for all objects $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, the product $X \\times B$ exists). Then, the exponential object, denoted $C^B$, equipped with morphism $\\epsilon: C^B \\times B \\rightarrow B$, is an object such that for any object $A$ and morphism $f: A \\times B \\rightarrow C$, there exists a unique morphism $\\lambda f: A \\rightarrow C^B$ (called the \\emph{transpose} of $f$) that makes the following diagram commute:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\nWe show the product morphism of $\\lambda f$ with $1_B$ in the commutative diagram below for clarity:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nThe uniqueness of $\\lambda f$ and $1_B$, and the uniqueness of product morphisms imply that $\\lambda f \\times 1_B$ is also unique.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 7\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \nSuppose we are in $\\textbf{Set}$ and we have sets $\\mathbb{B}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$.

Then, the function type B -&gt; C together with a function eval' :: (B -&gt; C, B) -&gt; C (recall that (A, B) is the product of types A and B) given by eval' (f, b) = f b is the exponential object $\\mathtt{C}^\\mathtt{B}$. That means that given a function of g :: (A, B) -&gt; C, we can define a new function gT :: A -&gt; B -&gt; C given by gT a = \\b -&gt; g (a, b) so that g (a, b) == (eval' . (prod' gT id)) (a, b). You should notice that gT is the curried equivalent of g.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nWe have seen some examples of universal properties which show that these properties are not unique to a particular category, but instead can be described in any arbitrary category. The formal definition of a universal property is not exactly necessary for understanding later sections, but is good to know. We define universal properties and connect them to products and exponentials in the appendix. Perhaps the most pertinent to our discussion is the fact that universal properties like products and exponentials can be described on any particular category, including categories with categories as objects.\nNatural Transformations\nIn categories, sometimes morphisms do not depend in an essential way on the particular objects they relate. For example, our definition of the projection function on products fst' and snd' operate on the pair (Int, Char), but these functions can operate on a pair of any two types a and b and be defined identically. These are the polymorphic functions fst :: (a, b) -&gt; a and snd :: (a, b) -&gt; b which can be described as a family or collection of morphisms, one of each for every product type (A, B). Such a family is known as a natural transformation, which we will define in this section, and we shall also give some intuition of why we can describe natural transformations as being morphisms between functors.\n\nSuppose in $\\textbf{Set}$ we have objects $\\mathbb{A}$, $\\mathbb{B}$ and their product $\\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{B}$.\nThe swap function $\\text{swap}_{\\mathbb{A}, \\mathbb{B}}(a, b) = (b, a)$ maps $\\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{B}$ to $\\mathbb{B} \\times \\mathbb{A}$.\nNotice that for any objects $\\mathbb{C}$ and $\\mathbb{D}$ there is also its own swap function $\\text{swap}_{\\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{D}}: \\mathbb{C}\\times \\mathbb{D} \\to \\mathbb{D} \\times \\mathbb{C}$ defined as the more generic $\\text{swap}(c, d) = (d, c)$. The swap function does not depend on the particular objects it swaps, since it is defined in the same way for any pair of objects. Such a definition allows swap to preserve composition. For any functions $f: \\mathbb{A} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ and $g: \\mathbb{B} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{D}$, the following diagram commutes:\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nAs we can see, swapping does not depend on the objects it acts on. As such, we can define swap as an entire collection of functions, one for each product. Since this collection preserves composition of morphisms, we can now begin to build some intuition on such collections as morphisms between functors.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 7 (Product Category).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      For a category $\\mathcal{C}$, the product category $\\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C}$ has:\n\nfor all objects $a, b \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C})$, object $(a, b) \\in \\text{ob}(\\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C})$\nfor all morphisms $f, g \\in \\text{mor}(\\mathcal{C})$, morphism $(f, g) \\in \\text{mor}(\\mathcal{C}\\times \\mathcal{C})$\n\nwhere composition of morphisms is defined componentwise.1\n1\nThis definition of product categories generalizes to a product of two categories, and is indeed a construction of the product of two objects (categories) in $\\textbf{Cat}$.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nNow we suppose $\\mathcal{C}$ has products. Then there is a product functor $P: \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}$ given by $P(A, B) = A \\times B$ for objects $(A, B)$ and $P(f, g) = f \\times g$ for morphisms $(f, g)$, and a swapped product functor $S: \\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}$ given by $S(A, B) = B \\times A$ and $S(f, g) = g \\times f$. We can now see that for every morphism $(f: A \\rightarrow C, g: B \\rightarrow D)$ in $\\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C}$ the following diagram commutes in $\\mathcal{C}$:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nThis generalization of swap as a family of morphisms between the images of two functors that preserve functoriality of $P$ and $S$ is precisely a natural transformation from $P$ to $S$, which we shall define as the following:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 8 (Natural Transformation).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ and a parallel pair of functors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$ and $G: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$.

The simplest among them, which is used to define the other forms of composition, is known as vertical composition, which is composed componentwose.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 9 (Vertical Composition).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ and parallel functors $F, G, H: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ with natural transformations $\\alpha: F \\Rightarrow G$ and $\\beta: G \\Rightarrow H$.   Then the vertical composition of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denoted $\\beta \\circ \\alpha: F \\Rightarrow H$ is composition done component-wise: i.e. $(\\beta \\circ \\alpha)_X = \\beta_X \\circ \\alpha_X$:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nOr depicted as a globular diagram:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n\nVertical composition is associative and unital; the identity natural transformation on a functor $F$ is given by $(1_F)_X = 1_{F(X)}$ and is natural in $X$:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\nTo describe another way of composing natural transformations, we need to define a binary operation between a functor and a natural transformation, known as whiskering.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 10 (Whiskering).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have parallel functors $F,G: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ and a natural transformation $\\alpha: F \\Rightarrow G$, and another functor $H: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{E}$. Then, whiskering $\\alpha$ with $H$, denoted $H\\alpha$, is the resulting natural transformation $H\\alpha: H\\circ F \\Rightarrow H \\circ G$ and $(H\\alpha)_X = H(\\alpha_X)$ where $\\circ$ describes functor composition:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nDepicted as a globular diagram:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n\nAlternatively if we have a functor $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ and parallel functors $G,H:\\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{E}$ with natural transformation $\\alpha: G \\Rightarrow H$ then we get the natural transformation $\\alpha F: (G \\circ F) \\Rightarrow (H \\circ F)$ where $(\\alpha F)_X = \\alpha_{F(X)}$:\n\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nAnd as a globular diagram:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\nWhiskering allows us to define horizontal composition succinctly.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 11 (Horizontal Composition).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have parallel functors $F, G: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ and $H, K: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{E}$, and two natural transformations $\\alpha: F \\Rightarrow G$ and $\\beta: H \\Rightarrow K$. The horizontal composition of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, denoted $\\beta * \\alpha: H \\circ F \\Rightarrow K \\circ G$, is given by $\\beta * \\alpha = \\beta G \\circ H\\alpha = K\\alpha \\circ \\beta F$. This is most easily shown with a globular diagram:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nAlternatively, with the following commutative diagrams:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\nThe following globular diagrams help us understand the correspondence of horizontal composition with vertical composition and whiskering:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\n\nHorizontal composition is also associative and unital. However, take note that the identity, unlike with vertical composition, is in general, not the identity natural transformation on any functor $F$ i.e. $1_F$ which contains the family of morphisms $(1_F)_X = 1_{F(X)}$; if we have $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ (parallel to itself) and its identity natural transformation $1_F: F \\Rightarrow F$ horizontally composed with a natural transformation $\\beta: G \\Rightarrow H$ between two parallel functors $G, H: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{E}$, we get $\\beta F: G \\circ F \\Rightarrow H \\circ F$, which is simply whiskering:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\n\nInstead, the identity of horizontal composition is the identity natural transformation of the identity functor of a category. Given category $\\mathcal{C}$, its identity functor $1_\\mathcal{C}$ maps all objects and morphisms to themselves, i.e. $1_\\mathcal{C}(X) = X$ and $1_\\mathcal{C}(f) = f$ for all objects $X$ and morphisms $f$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ (this is the identity morphism of an object $\\mathcal{C}$ in the category of categories). The identity natural transformation of $1_\\mathcal{C}$, i.e. $1_{1_\\mathcal{C}}$ simply contains the identity morphisms in $\\mathcal{C}$, i.e. $(1_{1_\\mathcal{C}})_X = 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}(X)} = 1_X$ for each object $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. This is indeed the identity for horizontal composition. If we have $\\beta: F \\Rightarrow G$ where $F,G: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$, then $\\beta * 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}}: F \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C} \\Rightarrow G \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C}$ will be defined as $\\beta * 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}} = \\beta 1_\\mathcal{C} \\circ F1_{1_\\mathcal{C}}$. As per the definition of whiskering, we have $(\\beta 1_\\mathcal{C})_X = \\beta_{1_\\mathcal{C}(X)} = \\beta_X$ so $\\beta 1_\\mathcal{C} = \\beta$, and $(F 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}})_X = F((1_{1_\\mathcal{C}})_X) = F(1_{1_\\mathcal{C}(X)}) = F(1_X) = 1_{F(X)} = (1_F)_X$ so $F 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}}$ is the identity natural transformation $1_F$, which we know is an identity for vertical composition with $\\beta$, i.e. $\\beta * 1_{1_\\mathcal{C}} = \\beta \\circ 1_F = \\beta$:\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nWith similar arguments you can show that $1_{1_\\mathcal{D}} * \\beta = \\beta$.\nAs stated earlier, the identity natural transformation on the identity functor on a category is precisely the family of identity morphisms in a category. In our category of types $\\mathcal{T}$, $(1_{1_\\mathcal{T}})_A = 1_A$, which is the identity function id :: a -&gt; a given by id x = x.\nCorrespondence with Polymorphic Functions\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 9.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have two functorial type constructors: non-empty lists, and boxes.\n\nLetting $F: \\mathcal{T} \\to \\mathcal{T}$ be the NEL functor, and $G: \\mathcal{T} \\to \\mathcal{T}$ be the Box functor, we have the following commutative diagrams describing the action of $F$ and $G$ in the category of types $\\mathcal{T}$:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nNow let us define a function toBox that receives a nonempty list of integers and puts its first element in a box:\n\nWe can see that this function is a single morphism from NEL Int to Box Int. Clearly, this definition should not be restricted to the Int type argument since the same definition applies to all types a:\n\nThis allows toBox to be natural in all types a:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n\nNaturality of toBox should be easy to show, since its definition does not depend on what the type a is.\n\n    \n  \n\nFunctor Categories\nIn fact, functors also assemble into categories. Such a category has functors as objects and natural transformations between them as morphisms.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 12 (Functor Category).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have categories $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$. The functor category $\\mathcal{D}^\\mathcal{C}$ has as objects, functors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}$ and as morphisms, natural transformations $\\alpha: F \\Rightarrow G$. Composition of morphisms is defined as vertical composition of natural transformations, and the identity morphism of any object $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ is its identity natural transformation $1_F$.\n\n    \n  \n\nTo build some intuition for later sections, given category $\\mathcal{C}$ we shall define the category of endofunctors of $\\mathcal{C}$ to be $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$, containing all endofunctors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{C}$. Notice that the domain and codomain of these functors are equal, so they can be composed with themselves, i.e. since $F \\circ F : \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ is also an endofunctor of $\\mathcal{C}$, so $F \\circ F$ is also an object in $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$. We also know that functor composition is associative, i.e. $((F \\circ F) \\circ F)(X) = (F \\circ (F \\circ F))(X) = F(F(F(X)))$ for all objects (and morphisms) $X$ of $\\mathcal{C}$, so we shall denote $F \\circ F$ and $F \\circ F \\circ F$ as $F^2$ and $F^3$ respectively (all of these functors are objects in $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$).\nA natural question might be to ask, what is a morphism from $F$ to $F^2$? For example,\nwe know that functor composition is unital with the identity functor on the (co)domain category, i.e. $1_\\mathcal{C} \\circ F = F \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C} = F$, thus with a natural transformation $\\alpha: 1_\\mathcal{C} \\Rightarrow F$, we can construct two natural transformations from $F$ to $F^2$, $F\\alpha: F \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C} \\Rightarrow F^2$ and $\\alpha F: 1_\\mathcal{C} \\circ F \\Rightarrow F^2$. Notice that $\\alpha F \\circ \\alpha = F\\alpha \\circ \\alpha$:5\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 10.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have, as a natural transformation in $\\mathcal{T}$, the polymorphic function pairList which receives an object and puts two of them in a list:\n\nLetting $L$ be our list functor, we let $\\alpha L$ be pairList itself (applied to objects of type [a]) and $L \\alpha$ be fmap pairList.

Correspondingly, a natural family of isomorphisms in a category is a natural isomorphism, and they can likewise be seen as an isomorphism of functors. Natural isomorphisms also help us to loosen our notion of \"equivalence\" of categories. In the category of (small) categories, we get an isomorphism of categories $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ where there exists a functor $G: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ such that $F \\circ G = 1_\\mathcal{D}$ and $G \\circ F = 1_\\mathcal{C}$, in other words, $\\mathcal{C} \\cong \\mathcal{D}$. However, such an isomorphism is too strict to categorize an \"equivalence\" of categories. Instead, we can define a natural equivalence that replaces the equal sign earlier with natural isomorphisms, i.e. $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ are naturally equivalent if there exists functors $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}$ and $G: \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ such that $F \\circ G \\cong 1_\\mathcal{D}$ and $G \\circ F \\cong 1_\\mathcal{C}$. The natural equivalence of these categories is denoted $\\mathcal{C} \\simeq \\mathcal{D}$.\nMonoids\nMonoids are also algebraic structures, which is usually defined as such:6\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 14 (Monoid (Algebraic)).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A monoid $(M, \\cdot, e)$ is a set $M$ endowed with a binary operator $\\cdot: M \\times M \\to M$ and an identity element $e \\in M$ subject to:\n\nUnity. $e\\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$ for all $x \\in M$.\nAssociativity. $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x,y,z\\in M$.\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 12.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $(\\mathbb{N}, +, 0)$ and $(\\mathbb{N}, \\times, 1)$ are monoids.\n\n    \n  \n\nWe would, as always, like to generalize the notion of monoids to other categories. Let us attempt to generalize the monoid $(\\mathbb{N}, +, 0)$. We can see that a monoid has a set $\\mathbb{N}$, which is an object in $\\textbf{Set}$. We also have a binary operation $\\cdot$, which we can model as a function on the cartesian product of $\\mathbb{N}$ with itself, to $\\mathbb{N}$, i.e. $\\cdot: \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ given by $\\cdot(x, y) = x + y$. The identity element can be seen as a function $\\epsilon: I \\to \\mathbb{N}$ from any singleton set to $\\mathbb{N}$. For example, let the singleton be $I = {1}$. Then we can define $\\epsilon:I \\to \\mathbb{N}$ be given by $\\epsilon(x) = 0$.\nNow, observe the following:\n\nFor all sets $A, B$ and $C$ we can see that $A \\times (B \\times C)$ and $(A \\times B) \\times C$ is isomorphic, given by $f(a, (b, c)) = ((a, b), c)$ and $f^{-1}((a, b), c) = (a, (b, c))$. This gives us a natural isomorphism $\\alpha_{A,B,C}$ that associates the cartesian product of sets.\nFor all sets $A$, we can see that $I \\times A$ is isomorphic to $A$, given by $f(i, a) = a$ and $f^{-1}(a) = (1, a)$ (recall that 1 is the only element in $I$). This gives us a natural isomorphism $\\lambda_A$ that shows an isomorphism between $A$ and $I \\times A$.\nSimilarly, for all sets $A$, we can see that $A \\times I$ is isomorphic to $A$, given by $f(a, i) = a$ and $f^{-1}(a) = (a, 1)$. This gives us a natural isomorphism $\\rho_A$ that shows an isomorphism between $A$ and $A \\times I$.\n\nBased on these observations, the following diagrams commute. The first diagram shows that for $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $a + b \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$, while the second shows that $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$ where $0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nAnother question to ask is, in what categories do monoids arise? Let us observe that in $\\textbf{Set}$, together with the cartesian product $\\times$ and a singleton set $I$, the following diagrams commute:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nLet us finally generalize these observations to define monoids in a monoidal category. First, we generalize the cartesian product $\\times$ to a monoidal product $\\otimes$ that associate up to natural isomorphisms $\\alpha$, $\\lambda$ and $\\rho$.

First, let us recall that, given category $\\mathcal{C}$, we can obtain the category of endofunctors of $\\mathcal{C}$, denoted $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$. $(\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}, \\circ, 1_\\mathcal{C})$ is a monoidal category ($\\circ$ here represents functor composition). We know that functor composition is associative (i.e. $(F\\circ(G\\circ H)) = ((F\\circ G)\\circ H)$) and unital (i.e. $F \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C} = 1_\\mathcal{C} \\circ F = F$), and thus we have natural isomorphisms $\\alpha_{A,B,C}, \\lambda_A$ and $\\rho_A$ that are equalities, i.e. $\\alpha_{A,B,C}: (A\\circ(B\\circ C)) = ((A\\circ B)\\circ C)$, $\\lambda_A: 1_\\mathcal{C} \\circ A = A$ and $\\rho_A: A \\circ 1_\\mathcal{C} = A$ with components $(\\alpha_{A,B,C})_X=1_{A(B(C(X)))}, (\\lambda_A)_X = (\\rho_A)_X=1_{A(X)}$. Thus, the commutativity of the pentagon and triangle diagrams for monoidal categories follows immediately:\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\n\nWe make special note of the horizontal composition of natural transformations in the diagrams. For the pentagon diagram, recall that $1_A * \\alpha_{B,C,D} = A\\alpha_{B,C,D}$. As such, the components $(1_A * \\alpha_{B,C,D})_X = (A\\alpha_{B,C,D})_X = A((\\alpha_{B,C,D})_X) = A(1_{B(C(D(X)))})$. By functoriality of $A$, $A(1_{B(C(D(X)))}) = 1_{A(B(C(D(X))))}$. Similarly, since $\\alpha_{A,B,C} * 1_D = \\alpha_{A,B,C}D$, $(\\alpha_{A,B,C} * 1_D)_X = (\\alpha_{A,B,C}D)_X = (\\alpha_{A,B,C})_{D(X)} = 1_{A(B(C(D(X))))}$. For the triangle, $(1_A * \\lambda_B)_X =(A\\lambda_B)_X=A((\\lambda_B)_X)=A(1_{B(X)})=1_{A(B(X))} = (\\rho_A)_{B(X)} = (\\rho_AB)_X =(\\rho_A * 1_B)_X$.\n\nWhen $\\alpha$, $\\lambda$ and $\\rho$ represent equalities, we have what is known as a strict monoidal category. Thus, $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$ is a strict monoidal category. As such, we shall do away with the symbol for functor composition (like before) since any interpretation of $ABCD$ for functors $A,B,C$ and $D$ is the same functor.\nNow let us determine what a monoid in $\\mathcal{C}^\\mathcal{C}$ will look like. Such a monoid $(M, \\mu, \\epsilon)$ will have natural transformations $\\mu: M^2 \\Rightarrow M$ and $\\epsilon: 1_\\mathcal{C} \\Rightarrow M$ where the following diagrams commute:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nObserve:\n\nIn the pentagon diagram, $\\alpha$ represents an equality, $\\mu * 1_M = \\mu M$ and $1_M * \\mu = M\\mu$.\nIn the triangle, $1_\\mathcal{C}M=M1_\\mathcal{C} = M$, $\\epsilon * 1_M = \\epsilon M$, $1_M * \\epsilon = M \\epsilon$, and $\\lambda_M$ and $\\rho_M$ represent equalities.\n\nAs such, we can collapse each of the two diagrams into a square:\n\n  \n\n\n  Click on quiver logo to view full diagram\n\nYou might be surprised to know that this is the definition of a monad on $\\mathcal{C}$. As such, a monad on $\\mathcal{C}$ is a monoid in the category of endofunctors of $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 17 (Monad).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      A monad $(M, \\mu, \\epsilon)$ on $\\mathcal{C}$ is an endofunctor $M: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ equipped with two natural transformations $\\mu:M^2 \\Rightarrow M$ and $\\epsilon: 1_\\mathcal{C} \\Rightarrow M$ such that the following diagrams commute:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Example 15.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Recall our list functor $L$ that maps types to a list of that type, and lifts functions on types to functions on lists of those types. $L$ is clearly an endofunctor of $\\mathcal{T}$, because the list type(s) are also types. As such, let us define the natural transformation concatAll that takes a list of list of types and concatenates its elements together:\n\nNaturality of concatAll should be intuitive. Then, let us define the singleton function that puts an object by itself in a list:\n\nAgain, naturality of singleton should be intuitive. With these functions, $(L,$ concatAll, singleton$)$ is a monad. The consequence of this is that concatAll . concatAll and concatAll . fmap concatAll are the same polymorphic function:\n\nBoth concatAll . singleton and concatAll . fmap singleton are the identity function on lists:\n\n\n    \n  \n\nWhy Monads?\nMonads give rise to a consequence that is incredibly powerful in programming. Recall from Definition 17 that  $(M, \\mu, \\epsilon)$ is a monad if and only if for all $X$,\n(M1) $\\mu_X \\circ \\mu_{M(X)} = \\mu_X \\circ M(\\mu_X)$, and\n(M2) $\\mu_X \\circ \\epsilon_{M(X)} = \\mu_X \\circ M(\\epsilon_{X}) = 1_{M(X)}$.\nFurther recall what it means for $\\mu$ and $\\epsilon$ to be natural, i.e. for all objects $A$, $B$ and morphisms $f: A \\to B$, $\\mu_B \\circ M(M(f)) = M(f) \\circ \\mu_A$ and $M(f) \\circ \\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_B \\circ f$.\nNow, given monad $(M, \\mu, \\epsilon)$, and morphisms $f: A \\to M(B)$ and $g: B \\to M(C)$, let us define a new binary operation $\\oplus$ called Kleisli composition where\n$g \\oplus f: A \\to M(C)$, is given by7\n$$\ng \\oplus f = \\mu_{C} \\circ M(g) \\circ f\n$$\nLet us now show a correspondence between our earlier definition of monads and $\\oplus$. First, an incredibly elementary lemma:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Lemma 7.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have parallel morphisms $g, h: A \\to B$. $g = h$ if and only if for all morphisms $f: Z \\to A$, $g\\circ f = h \\circ f$.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. From left to right, if $g = h$ then for all $f$, $g\\circ f = h\\circ f$. This is simple to show by subtituting $g$ with $h$, giving us $h \\circ f = h\\circ f$. From right to left, since for all $f$ we have $g \\circ f = h \\circ f$, then we have $g \\circ 1_B = h \\circ 1_B$. By the property of the identity morphism we get $g = h$.\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Theorem 8.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Fix category $\\mathcal{C}$. $(M,\\mu,\\epsilon)$ is a monad if and only if:\n(A1) For all $f: A \\to M(B)$, $g: B \\to M(C)$ and $h: C \\to M(D)$, $\\oplus$ is associative, i.e. $(h\\oplus g)\\oplus f = h \\oplus (g \\oplus f)$.\n(A2) For all $f: A \\to M(B)$: $\\epsilon$ is unital, i.e. $f \\oplus \\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_{M(B)} \\oplus f = f$.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. First we show that conditions A1 and M1 are equivalent.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&amp;&amp; (h\\oplus g)\\oplus f &amp;= h \\oplus (g \\oplus f) &amp;&amp; \\tag{A1}\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow&amp;&amp; \\mu_D \\circ M(h \\oplus g) \\circ f &amp;= \\mu_D \\circ M(h) \\circ (g \\oplus f) &amp;&amp; \\triangleright \\text{ expansion on }\\oplus\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_d \\circ M(\\mu_D \\circ M(h) \\circ g) \\circ f &amp;= \\mu_D \\circ M(h) \\circ \\mu_C \\circ M(g) \\circ f &amp;&amp; \\triangleright \\text{ expansion on }\\oplus\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_D \\circ M(\\mu_D) \\circ M(M(h)) \\circ M(g)&amp;= \\mu_D \\circ M(h) \\circ \\mu_C \\circ M(g) &amp;&amp; \\triangleright \\text{ functoriality of }M\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_D \\circ M(\\mu_D) \\circ M(M(h))&amp;= \\mu_D \\circ \\mu_{M(D)} \\circ M(M(h))&amp;&amp; \\triangleright \\text{ naturality of }\\mu\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_D \\circ M(\\mu_D) &amp;= \\mu_D \\circ \\mu_{M(D)} &amp;&amp; \\tag{M1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nNow, let us show that conditions A2 and M2 are equivalent.\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&amp;&amp; f \\oplus \\epsilon_A &amp;= \\epsilon_{M(B)} \\oplus f &amp;&amp;= f &amp;&amp; \\tag{A2}\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; f \\oplus \\epsilon_A &amp;= \\epsilon_{M(B)} \\oplus f &amp;&amp;= 1_{M(B)} \\circ f &amp;&amp; \\triangleright\\text{ identity morphism}\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_B \\circ M(f) \\circ \\epsilon_A &amp;= \\mu_B \\circ M(\\epsilon_B) \\circ f &amp;&amp;= 1_{M(B)} \\circ f &amp;&amp; \\triangleright\\text{ expansion on }\\oplus\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_B \\circ \\epsilon_{M(B)} \\circ f &amp;= \\mu_B \\circ M(\\epsilon_B) \\circ f &amp;&amp;= 1_{M(B)} \\circ f &amp;&amp; \\triangleright\\text{ naturality of }\\epsilon\\notag\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow &amp;&amp; \\mu_B \\circ \\epsilon_{M(B)}&amp;= \\mu_B \\circ M(\\epsilon_B) &amp;&amp;= 1_{M(B)} &amp;&amp; \\tag{M2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nLet us call morphisms $f: A \\to M(B)$ as monadic morphisms. Theorem 8 shows us that a monad allows us to compose monadic morphisms via Kleisli composition associatively and unitally, and conversely, any definition of natural transformations $\\mu$ and $\\epsilon$ together with functor $M$ that gives associativity and unity of Kleisli composition of monadic morphisms is a monad. This is precisely the motivation behind the Monad typeclass in Haskell.\nLet us attempt to define our own monad typeclass in Haskell, where return' is $\\epsilon$ and join' is $\\mu$:\n\nThen, let us define Kleisli composition for all monads in Haskell:\n\nAs an example, let us create the list monad (where return' is the same as singleton and join' is the same as concatAll from Example 15), and two list-producing functions\n\nConnections to Monads in Programming\nHowever, in programming, our example earlier may be somewhat awkward. Let us look at another example. In many other languages, the Option type constructor represents an optional value, i.e. Option a is either Some a or it is nothing, i.e. None. Clearly, this Option type is also a functor. Let us also make Option a monad, so that we can compose functions that return optional values:\n\nWhat we would really like to have is a way to express sequential Kleisli composition, i.e. instead of h &lt;=&lt; g &lt;=&lt; f $ x, we could write something like f x &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt; g &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt; h which means \"first do f x, then monadically apply g to it, finally monadically apply h to that result\". It is relatively simple to define &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt;:\n\nWe can see from this definition that g &lt;=&lt; f is \\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt; g. This rather miniscule addition makes it syntactically convenient to compose monadic results via Kleisli composition:\n\nIn fact, if we provide a definition of &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt; for each monad, they do not need to also define join' since we can define join' based on &gt;&gt;=&gt;&gt; for any monad:\n\nWhat we have done was the re-construct the Monad typeclass and Maybe and [] monads in Haskell.\n\nFinally, a natural question to ask would be, how do we know that our list and maybe monads are actually monads? As per Theorem 8, we can show that these are monads by showing associativity and unity of Kleisli composition. However, other programming texts usually give a different set of laws expressed in terms of &gt;&gt;=. These laws are typically written as the monad laws for all x:\n(H1) return x &gt;&gt;= f ==== f x\n(H2) f x &gt;&gt;= return ==== f x\n(H3) f x &gt;&gt;= (\\y -&gt; (g y &gt;&gt;= h)) ==== (f x &gt;&gt;= g) &gt;&gt;= h\nWe shall show this to be equivalent to conditions A1 and A2 (and by extension, M1 and M2) shown in Theorem 8.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Corollary 9.\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      An endofunctor (along with natural transformations $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu$ defined in the obvious way) has associative and unital Kleisli composition if and only if it satisfies the monad laws.\n\n    \n  \n\nProof. Let us first show that condition A1 in Theorem 8 is met if and only if H3 is met:\n\nFinally we show that condition A2 in Theorem 8 is met if and only both H1 and H2 are met.\n\nConclusion\nWe have shown, through immense suffering, that we can construct a category of types $\\mathcal{T}$ with morphisms and functions between these types. From this, we have also shown.\n\na functor (in the programming sense) is precisely an endofunctor on $\\mathcal{T}$;\nproduct and function types (in the programming sense) are precisely product and exponential objects in $\\mathcal{T}$;\na polymorphic function (in the programming sense) is precisely a natural transformation between two parallel endofunctors on $\\mathcal{T}$;\na monoid (in the programming sense) is precisely a monoid in the monoidal category $\\mathcal{T}$ induced by the cartesian product and the unit type;\na monad (in the programming sense) is precisely a monad on $\\mathcal{T}$, which is a monoid in the category of endofunctors of $\\mathcal{T}$, which we know is a strict monoidal category, induced by functor composition and the identity functor;\nif in defining a monad (in the programming sense) we satisfy the three monad laws (in the programming sense), what we have is actually a monad on $\\mathcal{T}$;\n\nYour reward for finishing this document?

Then, $(A \\times B, (\\pi_1, \\pi_2): F(A \\times B) \\to (A, B))$ is a universal morphism from $F$ to $(A, B)$ which characterizes the product $A \\times B$. This means that for all objects $X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ and morphisms $f': F(X) \\to (A, B)$ in $\\mathcal{C} \\times \\mathcal{C}$, there exists a unique morphism $p:X \\to A \\times B$ which makes the following diagram commute:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nReplacing $F(x)$ with $(x, x)$ everywhere and the morphism $f': F(X) \\to (A, B)$ with a pair of morphisms $(f: X \\to A, g: X \\to B)$ in the commutative diagram above gives us the following commutative diagram:\n\n\n\nClick on quiver logo to view full diagram.\n\nDestructuring the pairs in the triangle on the left we recover the commutative diagram in $\\mathcal{C}$ given in Definition 3.\n\n    \n  \n\nNow we can also re-define our characterization of the exponential object in Definition 6 as a universal property.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Definition 6a (Exponential Object).\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Suppose we have a category $\\mathcal{C}$ with objects $B$ and $C$, and the category contains all binary products with $B$, i.e. for all objects $A$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ then $A \\times B$ is also in $\\mathcal{C}$. We define the functor $F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{C}$ given by $F(A) = A \\times B$ for all objects $A$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ and $F(f) = f \\times 1_B$ for all morphisms $f$ in $\\mathcal{C}$. Then, $(C^B, \\epsilon: C^B \\times B \\to C)$ is a universal morphism from $F$ to $C$ which characterizes the exponential object $C^B$.

Therefore, the collection of all objects in $\\textbf{Set}$ is not a set. This makes $\\textbf{Set}$ what is called a large category.\n\n2\nTypes and functions in Haskell do not actually assemble into a category due to $\\bot$ and seq, but we shall temporarily ignore these and assume they do.\n\n3\nThe fact that diagrams are formally defined in category theory blows my mind. Even still, diagrams also assemble into categories!\n\n4\nBy Russell's paradox we cannot have a category of all categories—this is the quasicategory $\\textbf{CAT}$. However, there does exist the category $\\textbf{Cat}$, the category of all small categories, which are categories where the collection of its morphisms forms a set. $\\textbf{Cat}$ is not an object of itself, because it is not small.\n\n5\nIn general, we cannot claim that $\\alpha F \\circ \\alpha = F\\alpha \\circ \\alpha$ implies $\\alpha F = F\\alpha$. This is only true when $\\alpha$ is epic (the categorical equivalent of surjective).\n\n6\nDefinition 14 should appear eerily similar to the definition of a category, shown in Definition 1. As such, we can quite easily model this set-theoretic monoid as a category: A monoid is a category with one object. To understand this characterization, allow $M$ to be the only object in a categorical monoid $\\mathcal{C}$, and $\\cdot$ be the composition of morphisms and $1_M$ be the identity. Then, we can see that this category fits the monoid axioms, i.e. $1_M\\circ f = f \\circ 1_M = f$ for all morphisms $f$ in $\\mathcal{C}$, and $f \\circ (g \\circ h) = (f \\circ g) \\circ h$ for all morphisms $f, g, h$ in $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\n7\nThis is also composition in a Kleisli Category.\n\n","id":"https://yongqi.foo/blog/posts/monads/","title":"Functors and Monads"}},"docInfo":{"https://yongqi.foo/blog/":{"body":89,"title":3},"https://yongqi.foo/blog/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://yongqi.foo/blog/posts/flix/":{"body":1956,"title":6},"https://yongqi.foo/blog/posts/monads/":{"body":6112,"title":2}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
